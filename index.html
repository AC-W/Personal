						<h2>About me</h2>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<p>
						I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering student studying at the University of Tornoto - St. Geroge Campus pursing a Bachlor of Appliced Science degree with a minor in Artifical Intelligence.
						<p>

						<p>
							In my spare time I enjoy working on personal programming projects and spend time in the outdoors, cycling and hiking. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Currently I am learning CSS and HTML by developing my own website and learning how to run a website on the internet. 
							I also have plans to develope mobile games for ios devices to learn the fundamentals of video game development and strengthen my problem solving capabilities.
